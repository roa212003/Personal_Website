Iâ€™m an Engineering student at INSA Centre Val de Loire, Blois campus, France. Iâ€™m passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, especially in Computer Vision. Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects to enhance my skills, and Iâ€™m looking for an internship in this state-of-the-art field of science.

In my spare time, I create graphic designs and illustrations which you can find on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/trois_21/). I also love to read, 
and write [blogs](https://medium.com/@trandaihan02012003) about machine learning.
